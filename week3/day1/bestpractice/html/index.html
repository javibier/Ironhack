      <p>Hemp seeds are exceptionally nutritious and rich in healthy fats, protein and various minerals.</p>

           <p>Cannabis sativa is not the only species of hemp plant, just as it is not the only species of cannabis with psychoactive ingredients. The DEA would be arresting people if hemp seeds have any detectable THC, so it must be well below trace in hemp seeds.</p>

           <p>Well, it's about time you did an article on hemp seeds and hemp oil! Thanks so much for getting the word out.

           I've been consuming hemp seeds morning and night for years. In scrambled eggs in the morning and on kale salad at dinner. Takes about a month to acclimate, as the fibre tends to really clean out the impacted cement in the digestive system.

           Then you drop about 10 lbs, and find that your food energy lasts way longer per meal..</p>
